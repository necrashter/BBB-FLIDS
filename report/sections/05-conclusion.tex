\section{Conclusion}

During this project, I learned a lot about new technologies such as Ethereum, Solidity, and blockchain in general.
I extended my pre-existing machine learning knowledge with federated learning technique.
Although my contribution to federated learning is limited, I did not come across the data standardization stage I devised in the literature, and therefore I think that it might be unique.
I also tackled the problems that arise when federated learning is applied in a blockchain system, such as model size restrictions.
By changing a single configuration parameter, the model size on the blockchain can be halved without any significant impact on accuracy.

Although I started with intrusion detection in mind, the project I developed can be utilized for other blockchain-based federated learning applications easily.
Furthermore, modular platform structure also allows others to develop different blockchain backends for this project.
